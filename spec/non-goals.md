- No code change in either repo — captures and evidence only.
- No bindings outside this slice's scope list above. A binding that
  turns out to belong to a sibling slice's family stays that slice's
  row; say so in this item's summary rather than adopting it.
- No re-litigating `path.join` (#276) or `unix.clock_gettime` (#277).
- No captures for class-3 rows.
- No promotion of the filed captures — ordering them is the goal
  owner's `compare`, after this slice reports.
