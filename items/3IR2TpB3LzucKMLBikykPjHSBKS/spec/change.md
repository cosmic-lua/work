Classify every binding in this slice's scope into exactly one class,
with evidence:

1. **degenerate-input-only** — nil reachable only for an argument shape
   no correct caller passes (the `path.join(nil)` class, closed by
   #276). Each is a raise-candidate: file one capture per binding,
   unparented, then `attach` it under this item's parent container
   with `--repo whilp/cosmopolitan`.
2. **environmental or data-dependent** — a correct caller can meet the
   failure (ENOENT, EINTR, bad input data). The union stays; verify the
   tuple is exactly `T|nil, err string, errno?` with nothing else
   sharing a slot. Each deviation gets its own capture — `unix.nanosleep`
   is the archetype, its slot 2 declared `integer|string remnanos` so
   the success remainder shares a slot with the error string.
3. **exact already** — no action; one summary row.

The evidence standard, per row:

- the C source cite, as `file:line`
- the `tool/net/definitions.lua` line
- one probe transcript against the built binary
  (`o/tool/lua/lua -e '...'`) demonstrating the reachability class
- the cosmic-side spend: `grep -rn '<binding>' cosmic/` in a cosmic
  checkout (one exists at `/home/user/cosmic`), listing the wrapper
  sites that guard or assert it today

Record the summary table (binding, class, probe command, capture id or
"exact") back onto THIS item with `gitboard spec`, then finish per
review.md's research-slice clause — the deliverable is board state, and
there is no product PR.
